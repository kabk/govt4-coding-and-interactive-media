        <h2>Coding &amp; Interactive Media Setup</h2>
        
        <p>On this page you will find a short description of the Coding and Interactive Media assignments one can choose from. Each class will have Coding one block of the first semester and Interactive Media the other block. The exercises and assignments are designed to connect and supplement each other on both technical and conceptual levels. One needs the skills learned in each class in the other class.</p>
        <p>It is possible to choose any of the Coding exercises and connect with any of the Interactive Media assignments. However, choose wisely, for when you first have Coding and then Interactive Media you will be asked to implement the lessons from the Coding exercise in your Interactive Media-assignment directly and when you first have Interactive Media and then Coding, you will be asked to execute your Interactive Media designs with the newly learned Coding skills.
         
         <h2>Coding Exercises</h2>

<h3>Exercise: Multi-Device typography</h3>

<p>Select a text from the list of suggestions and type-set it using HTML and CSS. Your design should adapt itself to the context of a desktop computer, a tablet and a smart-phone, and it should be printable.</p>

<p>It is possible to combine this exercise with the design of your Thesis.</p>

<p><em>It is suggested to pick a text from <a href="http://networkcultures.org/unlikeus/" title="Unlike Us">The Unlike Us Reader</a>. You can choose another text, as long as it is in the Public domain or under an Open Source license.</em></p>

<h3>Exercise: Useless Correlation Application</h3>

<p>Use a sensor to find out something about the user’s environment. Use existing web data (i.e. Wikipedia) to find relating or correlating information. This information need not be useful: it can be surprising, confusing, irritating, amusing or consoling.</p>

<p><em>Example: create an application that, based on the current location, shows the user places that have a higher yearly rainfall rate.</em></p>

<h3>Exercise: Poetic Spam Device</h3>

<p>Spammers have created simple techniques of automated and computer-assisted writing. Choose a subject domain, and create a template based mobile application that assists the user in bombarding the exterior world with related messages.</p>

<p><em>Example: ‘Fashionable Meditations’ saves its users time by providing its users with status updates that strike the right balance between the ridiculous and the sublime, juxtaposing epistemology with tight pants.</em></p>

<h2>Interactive Media Assignments</h2>

<h3>Assignment: Illumination</h3>
<p>It seems that from a literate culture we're moving steadily to an iconotextual culture. Where have we seen this before? Yes. In the middle ages. The dark ages. However, the aura around medieval manuscripts is very much different from that of webpages and apps. But we'll see about that.</p>
<p>Choose a handmade book from before 1650 preferably on a subject you find interesting, visit it and take pictures of it and translate the iconotextual and handwriting qualities of it into unstable media.</p>
<p>The assignment consists of several subassignments that will be given in class, one of which is to make sure that the chosen manuscript will lead to works that will start up your drive for more graduation projects.</p>
<p>Suggested textbook: "From Image to Interaction" by Arjen Mulder (available both in English & Dutch, see <a href="http://v2.nl/publishing/archive/articles/introduction-from-image-to-interaction">English introduction</a>)</p>

<h3>Assignment: Taboo</h3>
<p>I would ask you to design a new taboo, if only I myself knew how to. Therefor we will break one. The goal of this assignment is to find out about what your addition (by your graduation works) to the design landscape might be, without having to think about it too much. Secondly we'll look at the motives behind existing works and we will discover that ambitions far beyond are reach can be put to work within our fields of expertise.</p>
<p>Copy a work you feel jealous about not having made, from someone you admire and would have liked to have been.</p>
<p>The work to be copied can be in any field, genre and from any author, designer or artist. However, the copying itself can only be done using graphical and digital media. Investigate the context, audiences, sources & inspirations of the work as well as it's critical reception and translate those to a structure within your reach and skilss. For instance: a very large sculpture might be translated into a very large 3D-structure that only shows up in Google Maps.</p>
<p>The assignment consists of several subassignments that will be given in class.</p>
<p>Suggested textbook: In "Uncreative Writing", Kenneth Goldsmith (see <a href="http://www.veramaurinapress.org/pdfs/Kenneth-Goldsmith_uncreative-writing.pdf">excerpt</a>) shows the artistical benefits of copying without remorse.</p>

<h3>Assignment: Dead Performance</h3>
<p>Knowledge, facts and personal drive can be transported from speaker to audience during a lecture. But what is the function of the performative aspects, the gestures, voice, timing etcetera? Similarly, intellectual material, facts and stories can be transported using graphic design, but what is lost when the live aspects are gone? Is it really lost or can it be translated and preserved?</p>
<p>Go to a lecture and translate the performative qualities into a graphical performance using the recorded text.</p>
<p>The first subassignment is to find a lecture that fits to your personal interests and professional drive. It will be a direct link to your other graduation works. Other subassignments will be given in class.</p>
<p>Suggested textbook: "Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy" by Mircea Eliade (see excerpt <a href="http://www.veramaurinapress.org/pdfs/Kenneth-Goldsmith_uncreative-writing.pdf">here</a>). In this book the different aspects of live performance can be found.</p>
