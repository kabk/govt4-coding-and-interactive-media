        <h2>Coding &amp; Interactive Media Setup</h2>
        
        <p>On this page you will find a short description of the Coding and Interactive Media assignments one can choose from. Each class will have Coding one block of the first semester and Interactive Media the other block. The exercises and assignments are designed to connect and supplement each other on both technical and conceptual levels. One needs the skills learned in each class in the other class.</p>
         
         <h2>Coding Exercises</h2>

<h3>Exercise: Multi-Device typography</h3>

<p>Select a text from the list of suggestions and type-set it using HTML and CSS. Your design should adapt itself to the context of a desktop computer, a tablet and a smart-phone, and it should be printable.</p>

<p>It is possible to combine this exercise with the design of your Thesis.</p>

<p><em>It is suggested to pick a text from <a href="http://networkcultures.org/unlikeus/" title="Unlike Us">The Unlike Us Reader</a>. You can choose another text, as long as it is in the Public domain or under an Open Source license.</em></p>

<h3>Exercise: Useless Correlation Application</h3>

<p>Use a sensor to find out something about the user’s environment. Use existing web data (i.e. Wikipedia) to find relating or correlating information. This information need not be useful: it can be surprising, confusing, irritating, amusing or consoling.</p>

<p><em>Example: create an application that, based on the current location, shows the user places that have a higher yearly rainfall rate.</em></p>

<h3>Exercise: Poetic Spam Device</h3>

<p>Spammers have created simple techniques of automated and computer-assisted writing. Choose a subject domain, and create a template based mobile application that assists the user in bombarding the exterior world with related messages.</p>

<p><em>Example: ‘Fashionable Meditations’ saves its users time by providing its users with status updates that strike the right balance between the ridiculous and the sublime, juxtaposing epistemology with tight pants.</em></p>

<h2>Interactive Media Assignments</h2>

<h3>Assignment 1: Dead Performance</h3>

<p>Go to a lecture and translate the performative qualities into a graphical performance using the recorded text.</p>

<h3>Assignment 2: Illumination</h3>

<p>Choose a handmade book from before 1650 on a subject you find interesting, visit it and take pictures of it and translate the handwriting qualities of it into unstable media.</p>

<h3>Assignment 3: Taboo</h3>

<p>Copy a work you feel jealous about not having made, from someone you admire and would have liked to have been.</p>
